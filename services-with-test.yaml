        The sites use Google Analytics for basic site analytics gathering. There are two different tracking codes, one each for ACC and PEC. The analytics are helpful in understanding information about site visitors such as which pages they visit most frequently, which 3rd-party sites are the predominant referrers, what devices are used to browse the site, and even what search term people used when accessing the site through a search engine.

        In order to access the Google Analytics data please complete the following steps:

        1. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?dsh=5097050817100996478&continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount#FirstName=&LastName=) using your austintexas.gov email address. Note that the link takes you to a screen to create a *Google* account with an existing email address, rather than a new *gmail* account. You want to create the *Google* account.
        2. Email Jeff Moore ([jeff.moore@austintexas.gov](mailto:jeff.moore@austintexas.gov)), let him know you have created your Google account, and request access to the Analytics account.
        3. Sign in at [http://analytics.google.com](http://analytics.google.com) to access the analytics data.

        There are several free browser plugins that make performance tracking and site analysis even easier. While the ones listed below are all for Chrome, there are likely comparable offerings for other browsers as well.

        **Page load time** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-time/fploionmjgeclbkemipmkogoaohcdbig))

        - Use this to see how long website pages take to load. The detailed breakdown allows you to understand where a potential lag is occuring, which could be in the browser or on the network.
        - No account is required to use this plugin.

        **Page Analytics** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-analytics-by-google/fnbdnhhicmebfgdgglcdacdapkcihcoh))

        - Use this to see page metrics while you're viewing a page. This plugin will tell you, for whatever page you're on, what percentage of clicks away from the page went to a particular other page.
        - If there are two links to the same page then each link will display the same number. As of 1/12/2017 we are not tracking which of the two links were clicked.
        - A Google Account with access to the site's analytics profile is required to use this plugin.

        **Page Size Inspector** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-size-inspector/oepnndnpjiahgkljgbohnnccmokgcoln))

        - Use this to see how much data is loaded on each page, and what type of data it is. This can help identify if things like high-resolution images or external scripts are slowing down load times.
        - No account is required to use this plugin.

      Austin Convention Center’s digital signage is built upon the Four Winds Interactive system. Screens can display content as a group or be configured to run content independently. The screens do not have audio capabilities.

      Our exterior marquees are in 3 locations around the Austin Convention Center. These locations only display the same content. All marquee signs are energy-efficient LED panels.

      Deadline for digital signage submissions is 14 days prior to the scheduled start date of an event.

    title: Marquees Notes to Consider
    text: |-
      - The LED exterior marquees have limited resolution capabilities, which are not suitable for every graphic display type.
      - Keep in mind, the marquees are in sunlight and this can affect the legibility. White backgrounds are highly inadvisable.
      - Highly detailed graphics with intricate shapes may lose shape/readability.
      - Graphics must be submitted within exact pixel dimensions for each of the two (2) marquee dimension sizes.
      - We cannot resize flattened (rasterized) graphics to fit without significant distortion and/or image loss.

      text: "#### General Planning & Building Information\n\n-\tThe Austin Convention
        Center is a smoke-free facility.\n-\tClients and employees are permitted access
        to the service yard.\n-\tAnimals assisting disabled patrons are allowed in
        the facility.\n-\tHeating, ventilation, air conditioning and house lighting
        is provided only during show hours.\n-\tA licensed Emergency Medical Technician
        (EMT) is required to be on site when an  event has a planned attendance of
        5,000 persons or more (at any given time), regardless of whether the event
        is private or open to the public or when the Client leases the facility for
        the purpose of any type of sporting or athletic event regardless of attendance.\n-\tA
        preliminary agenda is required sixty (60) days before the first contract date.\n-\tA
        final agenda is due thirty-one (31) days before the first contract date.\n-\tLabor
        fees may apply to first room sets if room setup information (including times
        and equipment requirements) is not received within five (5) days of the first
        contract day.\n-\tChanges made within five (5) days of the first contract
        date are subject to reset fees (equipment and labor). \n-\tContractor or an
        authorized representative must be on-site when exhibitors and/or attendees
        occupy leased space.\n-\tContractor is required to pay the prevailing rate
        in effect at the time of the event for all services and equipment.\n-\tA request
        to add or delete equipment (a reset) or a request for a change (a changeover)
        to the first room set is subject to labor fees and/or the cost of the additional
        equipment requested. (See Equipment and Services Rate Information). \n-\tHelium
        balloons and special effect machines require prior written approval by the
        Department.\n-\tUse of tape or adhesive products, nails, tacks, pins, etc.
        on any surface in the facility is not allowed.\n-\tContractor must return

        of normal wear and tear. Additional fees are assessed for the disposal of
        excess refuse or display materials left on-site.\n-\tCosts for damages to
        the facility or for clean-up of the facility are billed to the Contractor.\n-\tEquipment
        inventory is maintained to accommodate simultaneous events and is assigned

        labor for set-up and tear-down.\n-\tThe Department maintains an on-site business
        center when deemed necessary.\n\n#### Exhibits and Floor Plans\n\n-\tContractors

        the floor plan to avoid costly changes involving exhibitions.\n-\tA preliminary
        exhibit floor plan is required one (1) year prior to first contract day.\n-\tExhibit
        floor plans must first be reviewed by the Event Coordinator, who then submits

        charges and may not be accessible for utility services.\n-\tAn exhibitor list,
        both in alphabetical and numerical order, is required so prompt service may
        be provided to exhibitors.  \n-\tExhibits in the ballroom require prior written
        approval.  Utilities in the ballroom are limited and the cost for providing
        utility and technical services to exhibits is the responsibility of the Contractor.\n-\tEvents
        for the show or sale of firearms require Department approval.\n-\tContractor
        must provide any equipment or labor services for exhibit booths, i.e. tables,

      title: Fire Regulations
      text: "The information contained in this brief outline does not by any means
        thoroughly cover the criteria and standards contained in the Uniform Fire
        Code, as adopted by the City of Austin, but it does provide the fundamental
        rules governing exhibits in any building open to the public.\n\nThe following
        entities are responsible for ensuring all regulations are followed: facility
        client, exhibitors, service contractors and the Austin Convention Center Department
        (ACCD). It is a requirement that ACCD reviews all event pre-planning documents
        and floor plans and is the only entity that can submit these documents to
        the Austin Fire Department for final review and approval.\n\nRemember, the
        fire codes for Austin may be different from other cities, and exhibitors will
        be responsible for complying with the Uniform Fire code. ACCD will take reasonable
        steps to ensure that you are allowed to display your products effectively,
        as long as it does not create a fire or life safety hazard to you, other exhibitors
        or people attending the exhibit.\n\nFloor plans for all shows are to be submitted
        to ACCD for review and approval. ACCD will submit the floor plans and event
        pre-planning documents to the Austin Fire Department’s Fire Marshal for approval.
        An approved copy will be provided to the event client. A copy of the approved
        plans must be available on-site.\n\nNo display or exhibit shall be installed
        or operated as to interfere with access to or with the visibility of any required
        exit or exit sign, nor shall any display block access to fire equipment. \n\nAny
        exhibit containing a roofed area of 100 square feet or more requires a fire
        extinguisher to be displayed at such exhibit.\n\nAll exhibit booths must maintain
        clear and appropriate exits from the booth. Any booth of 750 square feet or
        more must have a minimum of two exits as far from each other as possible.\n\nDisplays
        with any type of cover, e.g., tents, buildings, awnings, etc. must be 300
        square feet or less; if larger than 300 square feet they must meet the following
        regulations:\n\n- A single level or multi-level exhibit larger than 300 square
        feet with a covered ceiling requires protection from an automatic extinguishing
        system.\n- A booth with an open grate style ceiling does not have to meet
        this requirement. If there is any question, please forward a copy of the booth
        plans for ACCD and Fire Department review.\n- The upper deck of the multi-level
        exhibit must have a minimum of two exits as far from each other as possible.
        \ If only one (1) exit, the second level is limited to seven (7) people at
        a time.\n\nThe storage of crates and combustible materials not on display
        (including packing materials) is not permitted inside the facility, on the
        dock or at dock bays. Limited empty crate storage is provided and confined
        to the area authorized by the Fire Marshal.\n\nAll curtains, drapes, any merchandise
        or material attached to drapes or table skirts, decorations and decorative
        or construction materials are to be non-combustible or flame-retardant. Documentation
        affirming non-combustible or flame-retardant properties must be available
        on-site.\n\nCombustible waste is to be collected as it accumulates and should
        be stored in a non-combustible covered container which is emptied at least
        once a day.\n\nThe use of open flames, burning or smoke-emitting materials
        (candles, incense, lanterns) are not permitted in the facility.\n\nElectrical
        equipment is to be installed, operated and maintained in a manner which does
        not create a hazard to life or property.\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the
        Austin Fire Department, it is essential for public safety in any place of
        public assembly, the owner, agent or lessee shall employ one or more qualified
        persons to be on duty. These individuals shall be subject to the Austin Fire
        Department’s orders and shall be in uniform and remain on duty during the
        times such places are open to the public. Any fees are the responsibility
        of the client.\n\nThe following items may not be used without prior written
        approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office:\n\n- Display or storage of LPG (liquid
        propane gas)\n- Flammable or combustible liquids\n- Flammable gas\n- Cotton,
        hay, paper, straw, moss, split bamboo, wood chips, etc. All items must be

        display of automotive vehicles and equipment:\n\n- There is to be no more
        than five gallons of fuel or 1/4 the capacity of the fuel tank, whichever
        is less.\n- Fuel tanks are to be locked and all portable tanks removed. Locking
        the auto will be sufficient for cars in which the gas cap cover can only be
        unlatched from inside the vehicle.        \n- Ignition keys are to be removed
        and placed in a central location on site.\n- The positioning of such vehicles
        shall be subject to approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office.    \n- Vehicle
        operation will be limited to brief parade-type displays specifically approved
        by the Fire Marshal’s Office.\n- Vehicles, boats and similar exhibited products
        having over 100 square feet of roofed area are to have a smoke detector.\n\nThe
        following related to food shows:\n\n- Deep fat fryers are not allowed in the
        facility.\n- Chafing dishes are to be designed with a shelf for the fuel or
        chafing dish is to be placed on a sheet pan.\n\nPublic display of compressed
        flammable or toxic gases, hazardous materials, Class II, III or IV laser,
        blasting agents and explosives is only permitted after a review of the materials
        and/or devices is conducted and the proposed display has received approval
        of the Fire Marshal’s Office."

    text: "## \"Memorable dining experiences with outstanding service from our award-winning
      team.\"\n{: .acc-no-top-margin}\n\nWhen you go to a city, food is an essential
      component to properly exploring and understanding the culture in which the city
      sits, but in most cases that culinary conversation ends when you enter a city’s
      convention center.\n\nAustin is different. There is no disconnect. Our catering
      team fully steeps itself in the influences swirling around our city, and shares
      with visitors the various palettes that have become metropolitan staples.\n\nWhether
      you are in back-to-back meetings or out on the town, the Austin flavor is always
      on your taste buds. And once you get a taste, you will be craving to come back.\n\n-\tWe
      are committed to fresh, local cuisine made in house.\n-\tPartnered with the
      most innovative food trucks in the city for events.\n-\tEnjoy relationships
      with artisan suppliers across the city, ranging from butchers, bakers, and snack
      producers to spirit distillers, craft brewers and coffee providers. Just to
      name a few.\n-\tWe meticulously judge every aspect of the service, from menu
      offerings to presentation, to ensure your wishes are fully realized.\n-\tOur
      executive chef, Brad Kelly, leads the team with 41 years of culinary experience

      ## Embedded Media
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      ### Display a photo

      ```
      Insert via Contentful editor's "Insert media" button
      The "[EH 5 with risers]" text is the alt tag that will be used to replace the image for assisted-vision website visitors. In this case, it would be better to replace the photo title "EH 5 with risers" with "Photo of Exhibital Hall 5".
      ```

      ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      ---

      ### Link to a displayed photo
      ```
      Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the photo into the appropriate entry, generating:

      ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      Step 2: Enclose that entire embed tag, starting with the "!" and ending with the ")" in square brackets "[ ]", resulting in:

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)]

      Step 3: Copy the image URL from the embed

      Step 4: After the closed bracket "]", paste the image URL and enclose it in parentheses "()", resulting in:

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)
      ```

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      ### Link to a PDF

      [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf){: .acc-button .acc-button-secondary .acc-button-pdf}

      Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the PDF into the appropriate entry, generating:
      ```
      ![Insurance Requirements](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
      ```
      Step 2: Delete the "!" and change the text in the "[]" brackets to the text you want the link/button to display resulting in:
      ```
      [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
      ```
      Step 3: Add the PDF button classes in curly braces after the ")", resulting in:
      ```

    text: |-
      The Contentful editor uses a syntax called "markdown" to apply HTML tags to your Contentful markup. This allows interface elements such as tables, ordered lists, unordered lists, and headers to be invoked with ease.

      The application that builds the site on the server, however, uses a markdown superset called "kramdown" that allows for even greater utility. The [kramdown Quick Reference Guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) is a great starting point for familiarizing yourself with the syntax and its capabilities. The [Style Guide](/guides/style-guide) demonstrates how to use advanced markdown and class declarations to attach specific style rules to markdown elements.

      A Contact Block consists of meta data for a member of ACCD staff. Contact Blocks are typically placed in the Sidebar of a Page to provide a customer a clear point of contact in case they have a question about content on that page. Any available meta data about that employee will be displayed, and fields that are blank will not be rendered.

      Sometimes a Contact Block will be used to display a more generic contact point, such as the "Contact Sales" block on the [Book an Event](/book-an-event/) page. Contact Blocks can be easily configured to display this information.

      Contact Blocks are also used on contact pages and for Press Releases.

      do better.\"\n{: .acc-no-top-margin}\n\nOur environmental department initiatives
      are implemented with the full-team effort of experts, management, and staff.
      This group focus has resulted in us making great strides in recycling, composting
      and equipment upgrades.\n\nThrough those strides, the Austin Convention Center
      Department (ACCD) can now power both of its facilities with 100 percent renewable
      energy from onsite solar panels and a partnership with Austin Energy’s Green
      Choice Program. Not to mention, 50 percent of all waste generated is diverted
      from landfills by our extensive composting program.\n\nThe benefits from these
      advances are not limited to the reduction of our department’s environmental
      footprint. They also create a more enjoyable experience for all who visit our
      facilities and reduces operational costs for us and our clients.\n\n__Leave
      the car at home.__ Visitors can make it to the convention center with MetroRail
      and MetroBus stops right next to the facility. To explore the surrounding downtown,
      grab a Bcycle or car2go and be back in time for your next meeting.\n\n__Clean
      air, clean environment.__ Cleaning with green products and a smoke-free facility
      to limit particulates in the air.\n\n__Continual education to sustain.__ Our
      compliance officers teach the management and staff about conservation techniques.
      These teachings then not only become a regular part of facility operations,
      but a habit of everyday life.\n\n-\tTeaming up with you to reach solutions leading
      to a greener future.\n-\tOur sustainability initiatives help the planet and
      your bottom line.\n-\tWe help minimize your event’s carbon footprint.\n-\tMore
      recycling. Innovative reuse of materials. Lower energy costs.\n"

        with the Austin Climate Protection Program to develop a first-of-its-kind
        Departmental Climate Protection Plan. This plan is intended to help reduce
        the Austin Convention Center Department’s carbon footprint and help the City
        of Austin meet its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2020. \n\n  - The Department
        was verified carbon-neutral for 2013 following its purchase of 3,450 offsets.
        \n  - Currently, the ACCD is awaiting final verification for its purchase
        of 3,570 carbon offsets for 2014 and 2,860 carbon offsets for 2015 to officially
        become carbon-neutral for those two years.\n  - Carbon emissions are third-party
        verified every 3 years to insure carbon offsets purchased cover carbon emitted
        by the department.\n\n- We are continually educating clients and attendees
        on ACCD’s sustainability initiatives.\n- The Austin Convention Center's Catering
        Services division is equally committed to sustainability."

      ## Embedded Media
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      ### Display a photo

      ```
      Insert via Contentful editor's "Insert media" button
      The "[EH 5 with risers]" text is the alt tag that will be used to replace the image for assisted-vision website visitors. In this case, it would be better to replace the photo title "EH 5 with risers" with "Photo of Exhibital Hall 5".
      ```

      ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      ---

      ### Link to a displayed photo
      ```
      Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the photo into the appropriate entry, generating:

      ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      Step 2: Enclose that entire embed tag, starting with the "!" and ending with the ")" in square brackets "[ ]", resulting in:

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)]

      Step 3: Copy the image URL from the embed

      Step 4: After the closed bracket "]", paste the image URL and enclose it in parentheses "()", resulting in:

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)
      ```

      [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

      Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the PDF into the appropriate entry, generating:
      ```
      ![Insurance Requirements](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
      ```
      Step 2: Delete the "!" and change the text in the "[]" brackets to the text you want the link/button to display resulting in:
      ```
      [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
      ```
      Step 3: Add the PDF button classes in curly braces after the ")", resulting in:
      ```

      cultural diversity, live music, the outdoors and cutting-edge technology.\"\n{:
      .acc-no-top-margin}\n\nAustin offers conventioneers 300 days of sunshine a year,
      fascinating history, excellent hotels, world-class dining, a thriving cultural
      scene and top-flight golf courses.\n\nThe Convention Center has helped launch
      development in downtown Austin. The area features several new upscale restaurants
      and hotels, all within walking distance of the facility. There are over 7,500
      hotel rooms in the downtown area, including the 31-story, 800-room Hilton Austin
      located directly across from the facility’s north side.\n\nAttendees also enjoy
      a rich downtown environment with plenty of entertainment, including live music
      playing at more than 250 venues on any given evening. They’re also just steps
      away from the famous Sixth Street and Warehouse District areas. For a different
      pace, visitors can enjoy a stroll or a jog along beautiful Lady Bird Lake, which
      bisects the center of town and is bordered by 10 miles of hike-and-bike trails.
      Or they can join the crowd congregating on the shores of Lady Bird Lake, just
      below the Congress Avenue Bridge, to watch as 1.5 million Mexican free-tail
      bats take flight for the evening. \n\nAustin boasts 13 nationally registered
      historic districts. Conventioneers can enjoy touring the historic sights located
      downtown, like the Texas State Capitol and Capitol Visitor Center, Governor’s
      Mansion, Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, Austin Museum of Art, Mexic-Art
      Museum and O. Henry Museum. Also close by are the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential
      Library and Museum, located in the University of Texas, America’s largest college
      campus, Lady Bird Johnson National Wildflower Center, Zilker Botanical Gardens,
      the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Museum and many more museums."

      ## Section
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      A *Section* refers to a group of related *Pages* or *Sub-sections*. In order to define a relationship between a *Section* and a *Page* or *Sub-section* you must edit the *Section* field on the *Page* or *Sub-section*. A Page or *Sub-section* may only belong to 1 parent *Section*, but can be linked to from any page on the site using markdown links or sidebar content.

      ### Customizing a Section page*

      By default, a newly-created *Section* has no content on its root page other than its title and links to its child pages or *Sub-section*s.

      To add additional content to a Section's root page (i.e. the page at `/facility`) you can create a new Page and give it the same *title* and *slug* as the Section it represents. Content Blocks you add will show up above the links to the Section's Pages/Sub-sections, and sidebar content will display as normal.

      *&#42; This does not apply to the Calendar, Press Release, and Floor Plans sections which use custom layouts*

      ## Ordering
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      ### Drag-and-drop ordering

      Any time you can refer to multiple *Entries* (for example, multiple *Text Block*s within an *Accordion Block*) you can re-order them by holding & dragging the three dots on the left side of the entry reference.

      Examples of drag-and-drop ordering include:

      - *Menus*
      - *Text Block*s and *Accordion Block*s on *Pages*
      - *File*s on *Page*s
      - *Text Block*s on *Accordion Block*s

      ### Manual ordering

      Sometimes references are added separately and not displayed in a drag-and-drop-capable list. For these items, there is a `Priority` field that accepts an integer. This integer determines the order in which that item is displayed. For example, if you want the "Floor Plans" link to show up above the "Diagrams" link in the "Facilities" *Section* you would set its `Priority` to "1" and ensure that "Diagrams" was set to 2 or higher.

      The lowest number displays first.

      Entries that rely on manual ordering are:

      - Pages (to declare the order they are linked to on their parent *Section* page, if applicable)
      - Sub-Sections

      ## Menus
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      A *Menu* refers to a collection of links to *Page*s or *Section*s on the site. The following global menus are used on the site as of December 19, 2016:

      - Header (main navigation)
      - Homepage Tiles (the 6 big links on the homepage)
      - Primary Footer ("Quick Links")
      - About Footer ("About Us")

      ### Menus in sidebars

      *Menu*s can also be used to link to multiple pages from a *Sidebar*. For example, a *Menu* in the Facilities *Sidebar* might link to the "Contracts", "Regulations", and "Security Policies" *Page*s.

      ### Menu ordering

      You drag-and-drop *Menu* items to change their order.

      ## Contact Block
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      A *Contact Block* is a collection of employee meta data that can be used for display in a sidebar or on a Contact *Page*. Its visual representation is determined by the context in which it is added. Sidebar contact blocks display as widget-type content at the top of a Page or Section's sidebar, while Contact Blocks added to the main body of a Page will display as more of an address book.

      All the fields for a contact are optional, and blank fields will be ignored at render time.

      ## Press Releases
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      Press Releases are no longer published as PDFs, and are instead now published through Contentful as a Press Release entry. You can use Markdown to style lists and links just like you would on any regular page on the site.

      You can add a Contact Block to a press release, which will display the selected person's contact information beneath the Press Release body.

      Press Releases will be automatically organized based on the publication date set in the entry.

      ## Hierarchy
      {: .acc-style-guide-header}

      The "Floor Plans" *Section* is itself a *Sub-section* of the "Facility" *Section*.

      The children of the "Floor Plans" *Section* are the room types ("Ballrooms", "Exhibit Halls", "Meeting Rooms"), which are *Sub-section*s of the "Floor Plans" *Sub-section* (a *Sub-sub-section*, if you will).

      And finally the rooms themselves, which are *Page*s with a parent *Section* of the corresponding room type.

      So it looks like this: \\
      &rarr; Facility \\
      &rarr; &rarr; Floor Plans \\
      &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; Ballrooms \\
      &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; Ballroom A

      While most of the site is fully Contentful-driven and incorporates a standard two-column layout, there are a couple of pages and sections which are handled in a more custom, and therefore fragile, manner. Below is a list of those pages and guidelines on how to prevent them from breaking.

      #### Press Releases (Page & Section)

      Do not change the page Title or Slug values for the "Press Releases" Section or Page. Doing so will trigger a build error when the site attemps to recompile, preventing any future content updates to propogate on the live version.

      #### Calendar (Page & Section)

      Do not change the page Title or Slug values for the "Calendar" Section or Page. Doing so will trigger a build error when the site attemps to recompile, preventing any future content updates to propogate on the live version.

    title: Sections & Pages
    text: |-
      The top-level architectural elements in our Contentful spaces are Sections and Pages. Pages can belong to a Section (configured at the Page-level) or can be stand-alone pages with no parent section. For example, the "Hotels", "Directions & Parking", and "Downtown Austin" Pages are all configured as children of the "Visting" Section.

      You might notice that there is a "Visiting" *Page* in addition to the Visiting *Section*. This configuration exists in order to allow editors to create Section pages which consist of more than just links to the child pages. For example, the "Visiting Menu", comprised of the "Guest Services" link, has been added to the "Visiting" *Page* because Sections do not support the inclusion of such content. When creating a Page for a section it is important to make sure that the Title and Slug values are a direct match. In addition, the Page should not belong to a Section.

    text: |-
      The order of Pages within a Section is determined by their "Priority" value. Setting a Page to a Priority of "1" will cause that Page to show up first in the list of Pages in the Section.

      Pages without a Priority value will display below Pages with a Priority Value according to the date and time of their last update.

      Pages which do not belong to a Section do not need a Priority value, and Priority values are disregarded when Pages are added to Menus, which provide drag-and-drop ordering functionality.

      Pages can have specialized sidebar content to provide supplemental resources for the content on the page. Sidebars consist of two structural elements, as defined in the Page entry:

      1. Sidebar Blocks
      2. Files

      #### Sidebar Blocks

      Menus, Text Blocks, and Contacts can be added via a Page's Sidebar Block configuration. Entries will display in the order they are listed in Contentful.

      #### Files

      Files can be added to a Page, which will generate links to open the file in a new tab beneath any specified Sidebar Block content. In order to add a File to a Page it must first be uploaded in the Contentful Media gallery.

      The "Menu" entry is used to combine 3 entry types into a cohesive functional unit:

      1. A Section reference ("Guides")
      2. A Page reference ("Performance Tracking")
      3. An External Link reference ("External Link")

      Links display in the order they are listed in the Contentful Menu item, so simply drag-and-drop to rearrange them.

      Menus are used in:

      - Primary navigation
      - Homepage tiles
      - Sidebars (as a Sidebar Block)

          The sites use Google Analytics for basic site analytics gathering. There are two different tracking codes, one each for ACC and PEC. The analytics are helpful in understanding information about site visitors such as which pages they visit most frequently, which 3rd-party sites are the predominant referrers, what devices are used to browse the site, and even what search term people used when accessing the site through a search engine.

          In order to access the Google Analytics data please complete the following steps:

          1. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?dsh=5097050817100996478&continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount#FirstName=&LastName=) using your austintexas.gov email address.

          There are several free browser plugins that make performance tracking and site analysis even easier. While the ones listed below are all for Chrome, there are likely comparable offerings for other browsers as well.

          **Page load time** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-time/fploionmjgeclbkemipmkogoaohcdbig))

          - Use this to see how long website pages take to load. The detailed breakdown allows you to understand where a potential lag is occuring, which could be in the browser or on the network.
          - No account is required to use this plugin.

          **Page Analytics** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-analytics-by-google/fnbdnhhicmebfgdgglcdacdapkcihcoh))

          - Use this to see page metrics while you're viewing a page. This plugin will tell you, for whatever page you're on, what percentage of clicks away from the page went to a particular other page.
          - If there are two links to the same page then each link will display the same number. As of 1/12/2017 we are not tracking which of the two links were clicked.
          - A Google Account with access to the site's analytics profile is required to use this plugin.

          **Page Size Inspector** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-size-inspector/oepnndnpjiahgkljgbohnnccmokgcoln))

          - Use this to see how much data is loaded on each page, and what type of data it is. This can help identify if things like high-resolution images or external scripts are slowing down load times.

      title: Fire Regulations
      text: "The information contained in this brief outline does not by any means
        thoroughly cover the criteria and standards contained in the Uniform Fire
        Code, as adopted by the City of Austin, but it does provide the fundamental
        rules governing exhibits in any building open to the public.\n\nThe following
        entities are responsible for ensuring all regulations are followed: facility
        client, exhibitors, service contractors and the Austin Convention Center Department
        (ACCD). It is a requirement that ACCD reviews all event pre-planning documents
        and floor plans and is the only entity that can submit these documents to
        the Austin Fire Department for final review and approval.\n\nRemember, the
        fire codes for Austin may be different from other cities, and exhibitors will
        be responsible for complying with the Uniform Fire code. ACCD will take reasonable
        steps to ensure that you are allowed to display your products effectively,
        as long as it does not create a fire or life safety hazard to you, other exhibitors
        or people attending the exhibit.\n\nFloor plans for all shows are to be submitted
        to ACCD for review and approval. ACCD will submit the floor plans and event
        pre-planning documents to the Austin Fire Department’s Fire Marshal for approval.
        An approved copy will be provided to the event client. A copy of the approved
        plans must be available on-site.\n\nNo display or exhibit shall be installed
        or operated as to interfere with access to or with the visibility of any required
        exit or exit sign, nor shall any display block access to fire equipment. \n\nAny
        exhibit containing a roofed area of 100 square feet or more requires a fire
        extinguisher to be displayed at such exhibit.\n\nAll exhibit booths must maintain
        clear and appropriate exits from the booth. Any booth of 750 square feet or
        more must have a minimum of two exits as far from each other as possible.\n\nDisplays
        with any type of cover, e.g., tents, buildings, awnings, etc. must be 300
        square feet or less; if larger than 300 square feet they must meet the following
        regulations:\n\n- A single level or multi-level exhibit larger than 300 square
        feet with a covered ceiling requires protection from an automatic extinguishing
        system.\n- A booth with an open grate style ceiling does not have to meet
        this requirement. If there is any question, please forward a copy of the booth
        plans for ACCD and Fire Department review.\n- The upper deck of the multi-level
        exhibit must have a minimum of two exits as far from each other as possible.
        \ If only one (1) exit, the second level is limited to seven (7) people at
        a time.\n\nThe storage of crates and combustible materials not on display
        (including packing materials) is not permitted inside the facility, on the
        dock or at dock bays. Limited empty crate storage is provided and confined
        to the area authorized by the Fire Marshal.\n\nAll curtains, drapes, any merchandise
        or material attached to drapes or table skirts, decorations and decorative
        or construction materials are to be non-combustible or flame-retardant. Documentation
        affirming non-combustible or flame-retardant properties must be available
        on-site.\n\nCombustible waste is to be collected as it accumulates and should
        be stored in a non-combustible covered container which is emptied at least
        once a day.\n\nThe use of open flames, burning or smoke-emitting materials
        (candles, incense, lanterns) are not permitted in the facility.\n\nElectrical
        equipment is to be installed, operated and maintained in a manner which does
        not create a hazard to life or property.\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the
        Austin Fire Department, it is essential for public safety in any place of
        public assembly, the owner, agent or lessee shall employ one or more qualified
        persons to be on duty. These individuals shall be subject to the Austin Fire
        Department’s orders and shall be in uniform and remain on duty during the
        times such places are open to the public. Any fees are the responsibility
        of the client.\n\nThe following items may not be used without prior written
        approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office:\n\n- Display or storage of LPG (liquid
        propane gas)\n- Flammable or combustible liquids\n- Flammable gas\n- Cotton,
        hay, paper, straw, moss, split bamboo, wood chips, etc. All items must be
        treated with fire-retardant materials. Documentation affirming non-combustible
        of flame-retardant properties must be available on-site.\n- Welding or cutting
        equipment for show set-up or for demonstration purposes\n- Gas-fired appliances
        for demonstration purposes\n- Salamander stoves\n- Compressed gas cylinders.
        If approved, cylinders are to be firmly secured in an upright position.\n-
        Any cooking or heat-producing devices\n\nThe following are related to the
        display of automotive vehicles and equipment:\n\n- There is to be no more
        than five gallons of fuel or 1/4 the capacity of the fuel tank, whichever
        is less.\n- Fuel tanks are to be locked and all portable tanks removed. Locking
        the auto will be sufficient for cars in which the gas cap cover can only be
        unlatched from inside the vehicle.        \n- Ignition keys are to be removed
        and placed in a central location on site.\n- The positioning of such vehicles
        shall be subject to approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office.    \n- Vehicle
        operation will be limited to brief parade-type displays specifically approved
        by the Fire Marshal’s Office.\n- Vehicles, boats and similar exhibited products
        having over 100 square feet of roofed area are to have a smoke detector.\n\nThe
        following related to food shows:\n\n- Deep fat fryers are not allowed in the
        facility.\n- Chafing dishes are to be designed with a shelf for the fuel or
        chafing dish is to be placed on a sheet pan.\n\nPublic display of compressed
        flammable or toxic gases, hazardous materials, Class II, III or IV laser,
        blasting agents and explosives is only permitted after a review of the materials
        and/or devices is conducted and the proposed display has received approval
        of the Fire Marshal’s Office."

      [[[The journey map]]] was a critical artifact and a core element of [[[the research plan]]]. tells us who is using the site, when they’re using it, and what question they need to answer when they access it. This provides guidance on how to cluster content that is typically accessed at the same points in the different customer journeys.

      ```
      I think that would be another great thing if they had something that was centralized. Now you're an exhibitor. You're visiting this thing. Here's the services they provide. They have it broken down for electrical and stuff like that by event. If you're attending this conference, here's the electronic form you fill out. If they took all the services that you could potentially get from the convention center and have them on one form, because if you're an exhibitor and you want to take advantage of that, how many links do you have to follow?

      In 2002 I started using post-consumer plastic bags and wrappers as collage material. The graphics and slogans printed on plastic bags are the results of exhaustive market research by advertisers. With an Exacto knife, I take aim at these graphics and through the slow deliberate action of cutting, I extract, alter and subvert those consumer messages. Indulging my inherently playful nature, I take consumerism and wrestle it through the sieve of formal beauty. The resulting mandalas are intricately crafted works created by collaging pieces of detritus from a consumer society, revealing the beauty of disposable items that continually pass through our hands.

      Four sets of five vertical-format oil paintings depict native Texas plants: grasses, shrubs and aquatic plants; cacti and succulents; wildflowers; trees and vines. Each painting amplifies the various parts of a plant in realistic detail and texture, but the compositions are dynamic and abstracted. The paintings act as a botanical respite for visitors and a counterbalance to soften the harder edges of the center's architecture.

      This is an emotional map of Austin made using participants’ responses to a 20 question survey, with questions like ‘where did you laugh the hardest’ and ‘where did you feel deep sadness’. We used X and Y coordinates to locate a place, with a Z point “up” for a positive experience and a Z point “down” for a negative experience. The map is color coded to a chart of emotions and generated in ArcScene, and was a collaboration with David Michael O’Donnell. The peak is Barton Springs at Zilker Park. When emotion is connected to location, location is no longer space, but place.

      Selected Serigraphs from Coronado Studios’ Serié Project Master Printer and Artist Sam Z. Coronado (1946 – 2013) advocated the awareness of cultural diversity in our community by advancing the fine art of serigraphy. He strove to create a solid platform that allowed for both established and emerging Latino artists to reach a bigger audience, and in turn, empower their words and creativity to spread to a greater world.

      As my work evolves, I seek to explore that core concept...the effect of blending and transition from one color, form...and even material to another. I suppose that in a broad sense, this is my world view as well. That the key to things working between people of various groups...differing genders, religions, national origins, sexual preferences...and colors, lies in our ability to see the beauty inherent in each...allowing them to be who they are and our willingness to see the beauty in the subtlety that connects us.

      These tables are part of “The Umasi Collection.” This series is specifically designed to blur the line between furniture and sculpture-with perfect panels that collide into organic elements. Scrap steel, used telephone poles, abandoned trampoline parts, salvaged ship masts, old bicycle frames, crushed aluminum cans, and rescued beams from demolished buildings are the ingredients for this series. As a result, Umasi draws attention to what our society throws away and suggests other ways to use our debris. But it’s also a ready platform for other forms of social commentary, with references to art history, contemporary culture, and even the politics of war.

      Much of my furniture work is done in series. The source can be a whole tree, a tree trunk or, even a big limb.  This piece is from the series “Peoples’ Walnut.”  It is made from a huge limb from a walnut tree that fell into the street in front of Peoples Pharmacy.  I love to combine metal with wood and keep the wood in a natural state. In this case, the piece is still round like the limb. Recycled aluminum legs give the design a spin on the mid-century look.

    The Contentful editor uses a syntax called "markdown" to apply HTML tags to your Contentful markup. This allows interface elements such as tables, ordered lists, unordered lists, and headers to be invoked with ease.

    The application that builds the site on the server, however, uses a markdown superset called "kramdown" that allows for even greater utility. The [kramdown Quick Reference Guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) is a great starting point for familiarizing yourself with the syntax and its capabilities. The [Style Guide](/guides/style-guide) demonstrates how to use advanced markdown and class declarations to attach specific style rules to markdown elements.

    - Freeman is the Austin Convention Center's preferred audio/visual provider.
    - The use of an outside A/V contractor will incur electrical service and audio patch fees.
    - An A/V Contractor is responsible for providing cables of the appropriate length, with bare-end tails to connect to facility power sources.
    - Cables must not impede any entrance or exit.
    - Production requirements must be submitted 45 days before the first contract day.

    cultural diversity, live music, the outdoors and cutting-edge technology.\"\n{:
    .acc-no-top-margin}\n\nAustin offers conventioneers 300 days of sunshine a year,
    fascinating history, excellent hotels, world-class dining, a thriving cultural
    scene and top-flight golf courses.\n\nThe Convention Center has helped launch
    development in downtown Austin. The area features several new upscale restaurants
    and hotels, all within walking distance of the facility. There are over 7,500
    hotel rooms in the downtown area, including the 31-story, 800-room Hilton Austin
    located directly across from the facility’s north side.\n\nAttendees also enjoy
    a rich downtown environment with plenty of entertainment, including live music
    playing at more than 250 venues on any given evening. They’re also just steps
    away from the famous Sixth Street and Warehouse District areas. For a different
    pace, visitors can enjoy a stroll or a jog along beautiful Lady Bird Lake, which
    bisects the center of town and is bordered by 10 miles of hike-and-bike trails.
    Or they can join the crowd congregating on the shores of Lady Bird Lake, just
    below the Congress Avenue Bridge, to watch as 1.5 million Mexican free-tail bats
    take flight for the evening. \n\nAustin boasts 13 nationally registered historic
    districts. Conventioneers can enjoy touring the historic sights located downtown,
    like the Texas State Capitol and Capitol Visitor Center, Governor’s Mansion, Bob
    Bullock Texas State History Museum, Austin Museum of Art, Mexic-Art Museum and
    O. Henry Museum. Also close by are the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library
    and Museum, located in the University of Texas, America’s largest college campus,
    Lady Bird Johnson National Wildflower Center, Zilker Botanical Gardens, the Umlauf
    Sculpture Garden and Museum and many more museums."

    ## Embedded Media
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    ### Display a photo

    ```
    Insert via Contentful editor's "Insert media" button
    The "[EH 5 with risers]" text is the alt tag that will be used to replace the image for assisted-vision website visitors. In this case, it would be better to replace the photo title "EH 5 with risers" with "Photo of Exhibital Hall 5".
    ```

    ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

    ---

    ### Link to a displayed photo
    ```
    Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the photo into the appropriate entry, generating:

    ![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

    Step 2: Enclose that entire embed tag, starting with the "!" and ending with the ")" in square brackets "[ ]", resulting in:

    [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)]

    Step 3: Copy the image URL from the embed

    Step 4: After the closed bracket "]", paste the image URL and enclose it in parentheses "()", resulting in:

    [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)
    ```

    [![EH 5 with risers](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/6xXSpRQEFiy8YEiGyIOw6w/6f1272bbffd6c21296b2deac1b04d6a0/EH_5_General_Session_w_Risers__4_.jpg)

    ---

    ### Link to a PDF

    [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf){: .acc-button .acc-button-secondary .acc-button-pdf}

    Step 1: Use Contentful's editor to insert the PDF into the appropriate entry, generating:
    ```
    ![Insurance Requirements](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
    ```
    Step 2: Delete the "!" and change the text in the "[]" brackets to the text you want the link/button to display resulting in:
    ```
    [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf)
    ```
    Step 3: Add the PDF button classes in curly braces after the ")", resulting in:
    ```
    [Download the Insurance Requirements Document](//assets.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/2uawOvBxRu0symg40S8ICK/7e654b05ea6d459fc3eabb75a3a75c40/Insurance_Requirements.pdf){: .acc-button .acc-button-secondary .acc-button-pdf}

    ## Section
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    A *Section* refers to a group of related *Pages* or *Sub-sections*. In order to define a relationship between a *Section* and a *Page* or *Sub-section* you must edit the *Section* field on the *Page* or *Sub-section*. A Page or *Sub-section* may only belong to 1 parent *Section*, but can be linked to from any page on the site using markdown links or sidebar content.

    ### Customizing a Section page*

    By default, a newly-created *Section* has no content on its root page other than its title and links to its child pages or *Sub-section*s.

    To add additional content to a Section's root page (i.e. the page at `/facility`) you can create a new Page and give it the same *title* and *slug* as the Section it represents. Content Blocks you add will show up above the links to the Section's Pages/Sub-sections, and sidebar content will display as normal.

    *&#42; This does not apply to the Calendar, Press Release, and Floor Plans sections which use custom layouts*

    ## Contact Block
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    A *Contact Block* is a collection of employee meta data that can be used for display in a sidebar or on a Contact *Page*. Its visual representation is determined by the context in which it is added. Sidebar contact blocks display as widget-type content at the top of a Page or Section's sidebar, while Contact Blocks added to the main body of a Page will display as more of an address book.

    All the fields for a contact are optional, and blank fields will be ignored at render time.

    ## Menus
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    A *Menu* refers to a collection of links to *Page*s or *Section*s on the site. The following global menus are used on the site as of December 19, 2016:

    - Header (main navigation)
    - Homepage Tiles (the 6 big links on the homepage)
    - Primary Footer ("Quick Links")
    - About Footer ("About Us")

    ### Menus in sidebars

    *Menu*s can also be used to link to multiple pages from a *Sidebar*. For example, a *Menu* in the Facilities *Sidebar* might link to the "Contracts", "Regulations", and "Security Policies" *Page*s.

    ### Menu ordering

    You drag-and-drop *Menu* items to change their order.

    Press Releases are no longer published as PDFs, and are instead now published through Contentful as a Press Release entry. You can use Markdown to style lists and links just like you would on any regular page on the site.

    You can add a Contact Block to a press release, which will display the selected person's contact information beneath the Press Release body.

    Press Releases will be automatically organized based on the publication date set in the entry.

    ## Hierarchy
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    The "Floor Plans" *Section* is itself a *Sub-section* of the "Facility" *Section*.

    The children of the "Floor Plans" *Section* are the room types ("Ballrooms", "Exhibit Halls", "Meeting Rooms"), which are *Sub-section*s of the "Floor Plans" *Sub-section* (a *Sub-sub-section*, if you will).

    And finally the rooms themselves, which are *Page*s with a parent *Section* of the corresponding room type.

    So it looks like this: \\
    &rarr; Facility \\
    &rarr; &rarr; Floor Plans \\
    &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; Ballrooms \\
    &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; Ballroom A

    ## Ordering
    {: .acc-style-guide-header}

    ### Drag-and-drop ordering

    Any time you can refer to multiple *Entries* (for example, multiple *Text Block*s within an *Accordion Block*) you can re-order them by holding & dragging the three dots on the left side of the entry reference.

    Examples of drag-and-drop ordering include:

    - *Menus*
    - *Text Block*s and *Accordion Block*s on *Pages*
    - *File*s on *Page*s
    - *Text Block*s on *Accordion Block*s

    ### Manual ordering

    Sometimes references are added separately and not displayed in a drag-and-drop-capable list. For these items, there is a `Priority` field that accepts an integer. This integer determines the order in which that item is displayed. For example, if you want the "Floor Plans" link to show up above the "Diagrams" link in the "Facilities" *Section* you would set its `Priority` to "1" and ensure that "Diagrams" was set to 2 or higher.

    The lowest number displays first.

    Entries that rely on manual ordering are:

    - Pages (to declare the order they are linked to on their parent *Section* page, if applicable)
    - Sub-Sections

    - The LED exterior marquees have limited resolution capabilities, which are not suitable for every graphic display type.
    - Keep in mind, the marquees are in sunlight and this can affect the legibility. White backgrounds are highly inadvisable.
    - Highly detailed graphics with intricate shapes may lose shape/readability.
    - Graphics must be submitted within exact pixel dimensions for each of the two (2) marquee dimension sizes.
    - We cannot resize flattened (rasterized) graphics to fit without significant distortion and/or image loss.

  title: Fire Regulations
  text: "The information contained in this brief outline does not by any means thoroughly
    cover the criteria and standards contained in the Uniform Fire Code, as adopted
    by the City of Austin, but it does provide the fundamental rules governing exhibits
    in any building open to the public.\n\nThe following entities are responsible
    for ensuring all regulations are followed: facility client, exhibitors, service
    contractors and the Austin Convention Center Department (ACCD). It is a requirement
    that ACCD reviews all event pre-planning documents and floor plans and is the
    only entity that can submit these documents to the Austin Fire Department for
    final review and approval.\n\nRemember, the fire codes for Austin may be different
    from other cities, and exhibitors will be responsible for complying with the Uniform
    Fire code. ACCD will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are allowed to display
    your products effectively, as long as it does not create a fire or life safety
    hazard to you, other exhibitors or people attending the exhibit.\n\nFloor plans
    for all shows are to be submitted to ACCD for review and approval. ACCD will submit
    the floor plans and event pre-planning documents to the Austin Fire Department’s
    Fire Marshal for approval. An approved copy will be provided to the event client.
    A copy of the approved plans must be available on-site.\n\nNo display or exhibit
    shall be installed or operated as to interfere with access to or with the visibility
    of any required exit or exit sign, nor shall any display block access to fire
    equipment. \n\nAny exhibit containing a roofed area of 100 square feet or more
    requires a fire extinguisher to be displayed at such exhibit.\n\nAll exhibit booths
    must maintain clear and appropriate exits from the booth. Any booth of 750 square
    feet or more must have a minimum of two exits as far from each other as possible.\n\nDisplays
    with any type of cover, e.g., tents, buildings, awnings, etc. must be 300 square
    feet or less; if larger than 300 square feet they must meet the following regulations:\n\n-
    A single level or multi-level exhibit larger than 300 square feet with a covered
    ceiling requires protection from an automatic extinguishing system.\n- A booth
    with an open grate style ceiling does not have to meet this requirement. If there
    is any question, please forward a copy of the booth plans for ACCD and Fire Department
    review.\n- The upper deck of the multi-level exhibit must have a minimum of two
    exits as far from each other as possible.  If only one (1) exit, the second level
    is limited to seven (7) people at a time.\n\nThe storage of crates and combustible
    materials not on display (including packing materials) is not permitted inside
    the facility, on the dock or at dock bays. Limited empty crate storage is provided
    and confined to the area authorized by the Fire Marshal.\n\nAll curtains, drapes,
    any merchandise or material attached to drapes or table skirts, decorations and
    decorative or construction materials are to be non-combustible or flame-retardant.
    Documentation affirming non-combustible or flame-retardant properties must be
    available on-site.\n\nCombustible waste is to be collected as it accumulates and
    should be stored in a non-combustible covered container which is emptied at least
    once a day.\n\nThe use of open flames, burning or smoke-emitting materials (candles,
    incense, lanterns) are not permitted in the facility.\n\nElectrical equipment
    is to be installed, operated and maintained in a manner which does not create
    a hazard to life or property.\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the Austin Fire Department,
    it is essential for public safety in any place of public assembly, the owner,
    agent or lessee shall employ one or more qualified persons to be on duty. These
    individuals shall be subject to the Austin Fire Department’s orders and shall
    be in uniform and remain on duty during the times such places are open to the
    public. Any fees are the responsibility of the client.\n\nThe following items
    may not be used without prior written approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office:\n\n-
    Display or storage of LPG (liquid propane gas)\n- Flammable or combustible liquids\n-
    Flammable gas\n- Cotton, hay, paper, straw, moss, split bamboo, wood chips, etc.
    All items must be treated with fire-retardant materials. Documentation affirming
    non-combustible of flame-retardant properties must be available on-site.\n- Welding
    or cutting equipment for show set-up or for demonstration purposes\n- Gas-fired
    appliances for demonstration purposes\n- Salamander stoves\n- Compressed gas cylinders.
    If approved, cylinders are to be firmly secured in an upright position.\n- Any
    cooking or heat-producing devices\n\nThe following are related to the display
    of automotive vehicles and equipment:\n\n- There is to be no more than five gallons
    of fuel or 1/4 the capacity of the fuel tank, whichever is less.\n- Fuel tanks
    are to be locked and all portable tanks removed. Locking the auto will be sufficient
    for cars in which the gas cap cover can only be unlatched from inside the vehicle.
    \       \n- Ignition keys are to be removed and placed in a central location on
    site.\n- The positioning of such vehicles shall be subject to approval of the
    Fire Marshal’s Office.    \n- Vehicle operation will be limited to brief parade-type
    displays specifically approved by the Fire Marshal’s Office.\n- Vehicles, boats
    and similar exhibited products having over 100 square feet of roofed area are
    to have a smoke detector.\n\nThe following related to food shows:\n\n- Deep fat
    fryers are not allowed in the facility.\n- Chafing dishes are to be designed with
    a shelf for the fuel or chafing dish is to be placed on a sheet pan.\n\nPublic
    display of compressed flammable or toxic gases, hazardous materials, Class II,
    III or IV laser, blasting agents and explosives is only permitted after a review
    of the materials and/or devices is conducted and the proposed display has received
    approval of the Fire Marshal’s Office."

    While most of the site is fully Contentful-driven and incorporates a standard two-column layout, there are a couple of pages and sections which are handled in a more custom, and therefore fragile, manner. Below is a list of those pages and guidelines on how to prevent them from breaking.

    #### Press Releases (Page & Section)

    Do not change the page Title or Slug values for the "Press Releases" Section or Page. Doing so will trigger a build error when the site attemps to recompile, preventing any future content updates to propogate on the live version.

    #### Calendar (Page & Section)

    Do not change the page Title or Slug values for the "Calendar" Section or Page. Doing so will trigger a build error when the site attemps to recompile, preventing any future content updates to propogate on the live version.

    Links display in the order they are listed in the Contentful Menu item, so simply drag-and-drop to rearrange them.

    There are several free browser plugins that make performance tracking and site analysis even easier. While the ones listed below are all for Chrome, there are likely comparable offerings for other browsers as well.

    **Page load time** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-time/fploionmjgeclbkemipmkogoaohcdbig))

    - Use this to see how long website pages take to load. The detailed breakdown allows you to understand where a potential lag is occuring, which could be in the browser or on the network.
    - No account is required to use this plugin.

    **Page Analytics** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-analytics-by-google/fnbdnhhicmebfgdgglcdacdapkcihcoh))

    - Use this to see page metrics while you're viewing a page. This plugin will tell you, for whatever page you're on, what percentage of clicks away from the page went to a particular other page.
    - If there are two links to the same page then each link will display the same number. As of 1/12/2017 we are not tracking which of the two links were clicked.
    - A Google Account with access to the site's analytics profile is required to use this plugin.

    **Page Size Inspector** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-size-inspector/oepnndnpjiahgkljgbohnnccmokgcoln))

    - Use this to see how much data is loaded on each page, and what type of data it is. This can help identify if things like high-resolution images or external scripts are slowing down load times.
    - No account is required to use this plugin.

    The Style Guide can be broken down into two components:

    1. Visual output on the site
    2. The markdown required to generate it

    Each style element is labeled by a header which separates it from other style elements and which is its own style element (not used in the design system on the public-facing site). The header of this section, "How to read this guide", is an example of such a header. The headers are followed by the visual output and then the markdown. So,

    # This is the visual representation of an h1 tag

    ... and this is the markdown used to generate it, as it is written in Contentful:

    ```
    # This is the visual representation of an h1 tag

  title: Sections & Pages
  text: |-
    The top-level architectural elements in our Contentful spaces are Sections and Pages. Pages can belong to a Section (configured at the Page-level) or can be stand-alone pages with no parent section. For example, the "Hotels", "Directions & Parking", and "Downtown Austin" Pages are all configured as children of the "Visting" Section.

    You might notice that there is a "Visiting" *Page* in addition to the Visiting *Section*. This configuration exists in order to allow editors to create Section pages which consist of more than just links to the child pages. For example, the "Visiting Menu", comprised of the "Guest Services" link, has been added to the "Visiting" *Page* because Sections do not support the inclusion of such content. When creating a Page for a section it is important to make sure that the Title and Slug values are a direct match. In addition, the Page should not belong to a Section.

    The order of Pages within a Section is determined by their "Priority" value. Setting a Page to a Priority of "1" will cause that Page to show up first in the list of Pages in the Section.

    Pages without a Priority value will display below Pages with a Priority Value according to the date and time of their last update.

    Pages which do not belong to a Section do not need a Priority value, and Priority values are disregarded when Pages are added to Menus, which provide drag-and-drop ordering functionality.

    A Contact Block consists of meta data for a member of ACCD staff. Contact Blocks are typically placed in the Sidebar of a Page to provide a customer a clear point of contact in case they have a question about content on that page. Any available meta data about that employee will be displayed, and fields that are blank will not be rendered.

    Sometimes a Contact Block will be used to display a more generic contact point, such as the "Contact Sales" block on the [Book an Event](/book-an-event/) page. Contact Blocks can be easily configured to display this information.

    Contact Blocks are also used on contact pages and for Press Releases.

    I think that would be another great thing if they had something that was centralized. Now you're an exhibitor. You're visiting this thing. Here's the services they provide. They have it broken down for electrical and stuff like that by event. If you're attending this conference, here's the electronic form you fill out. If they took all the services that you could potentially get from the convention center and have them on one form, because if you're an exhibitor and you want to take advantage of that, how many links do you have to follow?

    In 2002 I started using post-consumer plastic bags and wrappers as collage material. The graphics and slogans printed on plastic bags are the results of exhaustive market research by advertisers. With an Exacto knife, I take aim at these graphics and through the slow deliberate action of cutting, I extract, alter and subvert those consumer messages. Indulging my inherently playful nature, I take consumerism and wrestle it through the sieve of formal beauty. The resulting mandalas are intricately crafted works created by collaging pieces of detritus from a consumer society, revealing the beauty of disposable items that continually pass through our hands.

    Not to mention, 50 percent of all waste generated is diverted from landfills by
    our extensive composting program.\n\nThe benefits from these advances are not
    limited to the reduction of our department’s environmental footprint. They also
    create a more enjoyable experience for all who visit our facilities and reduces
    operational costs for us and our clients.\n\n__Leave the car at home.__ Visitors
    can make it to the convention center with MetroRail and MetroBus stops right next
    to the facility. To explore the surrounding downtown, grab a Bcycle or car2go
    and be back in time for your next meeting.\n\n__Clean air, clean environment.__
    Cleaning with green products and a smoke-free facility to limit particulates in
    the air.\n\n__Continual education to sustain.__ Our compliance officers teach
    the management and staff about conservation techniques. These teachings then not
    only become a regular part of facility operations, but a habit of everyday life.\n\n-\tTeaming
    up with you to reach solutions leading to a greener future.\n-\tOur sustainability
    initiatives help the planet and your bottom line.\n-\tWe help minimize your event’s
    carbon footprint.\n-\tMore recycling. Innovative reuse of materials. Lower energy
    costs.\n"

    Four sets of five vertical-format oil paintings depict native Texas plants: grasses, shrubs and aquatic plants; cacti and succulents; wildflowers; trees and vines. Each painting amplifies the various parts of a plant in realistic detail and texture, but the compositions are dynamic and abstracted. The paintings act as a botanical respite for visitors and a counterbalance to soften the harder edges of the center's architecture.

    This is an emotional map of Austin made using participants’ responses to a 20 question survey, with questions like ‘where did you laugh the hardest’ and ‘where did you feel deep sadness’. We used X and Y coordinates to locate a place, with a Z point “up” for a positive experience and a Z point “down” for a negative experience. The map is color coded to a chart of emotions and generated in ArcScene, and was a collaboration with David Michael O’Donnell. The peak is Barton Springs at Zilker Park. When emotion is connected to location, location is no longer space, but place.

Coronado (1946 – 2013) advocated the awareness of cultural diversity in our community by advancing the fine art of serigraphy. He strove to create a solid platform that allowed for both established and emerging Latino artists to reach a bigger audience, and in turn, empower their words and creativity to spread to a greater world.

    As my work evolves, I seek to explore that core concept...the effect of blending and transition from one color, form...and even material to another. I suppose that in a broad sense, this is my world view as well. That the key to things working between people of various groups...differing genders, religions, national origins, sexual preferences...and colors, lies in our ability to see the beauty inherent in each...allowing them to be who they are and our willingness to see the beauty in the subtlety that connects us.

    These tables are part of “The Umasi Collection.” This series is specifically designed to blur the line between furniture and sculpture-with perfect panels that collide into organic elements. Scrap steel, used telephone poles, abandoned trampoline parts, salvaged ship masts, old bicycle frames, crushed aluminum cans, and rescued beams from demolished buildings are the ingredients for this series. As a result, Umasi draws attention to what our society throws away and suggests other ways to use our debris. But it’s also a ready platform for other forms of social commentary, with references to art history, contemporary culture, and even the politics of war.

    Much of my furniture work is done in series. The source can be a whole tree, a tree trunk or, even a big limb.  This piece is from the series “Peoples’ Walnut.”  It is made from a huge limb from a walnut tree that fell into the street in front of Peoples Pharmacy.  I love to combine metal with wood and keep the wood in a natural state. In this case, the piece is still round like the limb. Recycled aluminum legs give the design a spin on the mid-century look.

    The holiday season is here and the Austin Convention Center remains busy! From conferences to conventions, many different events are sure to keep the LEED® Gold-certified facility humming.

    Formula4Media, LLC will host The Running Event 2015 at the Austin Convention
    Center from December 1 through December 4. Over 250 exhibitors as well as over 1,000
    new running products will take the stage over the four-day event. For more information, go to [www.therunningevent.com](http://www.therunningevent.com).

    On December 11 and 12, Mecum Auctions will present the 2015 Mecum Collector Car Auction. Over 600 classic vehicles will be auctioned with NBC Sports Network on hand
    to show the action live on TV! For more details, go to [www.mecum.com(http://www.mecum.com).

    On December 5 and 6, Austin Area Art From the Streets will host its 23rd annual Art
    From the Streets Show & Sale. Art From the Streets is a volunteer-run program that provides a safe and encouraging place where people who are homeless come to draw, paint, and create during free, twice-weekly open studio sessions. The program culminates each year in the Annual Show and Sale, where participants exhibit and sell their work to the public. For more information, go to [www.artfromthestreets.com](http://www.artfromthestreets.com).

    Rounding out the December calendar are the Anti-Defamation League’s No Place for
    Hate Youth Summit on December 7 ([www.austin.adl.org/noplaceforhateyouthsummit](www.austin.adl.org/noplaceforhateyouthsummit)); the NAACP Austin’s 50th Anniversary DeWitty/Overton Freedom Fund Banquet on December 5 ([www.naacpaustin.com](http://www.naacpaustin.com)); and Kelby Training’s Adobe Photoshop Seminar Tour on December
    1 ([www.kelbyone.com](www.kelbyone.com)).

    A look ahead to January reveals fifteen different events scheduled at the Austin
    Convention Center.

    Nearly eight million people have attended 3,000+ events, including over 800
    conventions, at the LEED® Gold-certified Austin Convention Center since it opened in 1992.

    Events at both the Convention Center and the Palmer Events Center, and their websites, can be accessed at [www.austinconventioncenter.com](http://www.austinconventioncenter.com).

    The Austin Convention Center enjoyed an incredibly busy fall 2016 and is looking forward to more of the same as the calendar turns to 2017. Over 131,000 people came through the Austin Convention Center’s doors from the beginning of July through November and into December.

    Several conventions were held at the Austin Convention Center between July and early December, keeping the facility buzzing with action. Among the groups hosting these conventions were the American Society of Plant Biologists, National Instruments, Keller Williams Realty, Armstrong McCall LP, Wizard World, the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, South by Southwest (SXSW Eco), DELL, Inc., Emerson Process Management, Tableau Software, Spiceworks, Inc., and Deere and Company. These conventions alone totaled nearly 75,000 people in attendance.

    When there wasn’t a convention at the Austin Convention Center, there was a conference, consumer show, or other type of meeting that kept the facility booked solid through the late fall. Shows such as the Texas Conference for Women, 2016 Art From the Streets, the Fall Austin Home & Garden Show, and the 2016 Austin Game Conference saw huge attendance numbers and guaranteed busy days for the facility’s staff.

    In preparation for a similarly busy first quarter of 2017, the Austin Convention Center is undergoing many ‘touch-ups’ to put a fresh face on the facility for the new year. Along with the requisite painting and pressure washing, the facility is receiving new artwork from many local, diverse artists that will be displayed in high-traffic areas. The new artwork is sure to add a punch of color to the facility, catching the eye of every client. In addition, the brand new Atrium Café will be installed in time for many of the events scheduled early in 2017.

    Once 2017 arrives, the Austin Convention Center will be off and running with one of the most significant events in the meetings industry. The Chicago-based Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA) will host Convening Leaders 2017 – PCMA’s annual meeting – from January 8 through January 11. Over 4,000 top meetings industry executives will come to Austin for cutting-edge education, innovative learning, and great networking opportunities. Convening Leaders 2017 is one of eleven events scheduled for January, making for yet another very busy month for the Austin Convention Center!

    Nearly ten million people have attended 5,000+ events, including over 900 conventions, at the LEED® Gold-certified Austin Convention Center since it opened in 1992. Events at both the Convention Center and the Palmer Events Center, and their websites, can be accessed at [www.austinconventioncenter.com](https://www.austinconventioncenter.com/).

    The Austin Convention Center, for the first time, will welcome close to 4,000 professional meeting planner and supplier members of the Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA) for the organization’s annual Convening Leaders conference – taking place January 8 to 11.

    Convening Leaders is about professional development and networking for meeting industry professionals and highlights the latest innovations and trends in event technology, meeting design and business event strategy. Given the importance of this group, the Austin hospitality community is showing the best Austin has to offer, looking to ‘wow’ this group of influential decision makers with the goal of securing future convention contracts. The potential economic benefit to Austin is unprecedented, as each attendee represents potential business for Austin’s economy.

    “We are excited to be in Austin for Convening Leaders 2017,” said Deborah Sexton, PCMA President and CEO. “Austin is a high energy destination and the Austin Convention Center is located in the heart of a vibrant downtown scene, supported by an expansion of new hotel offerings. Our PCMA Convening Leaders attendees will experience this unique city and convention center that nurtured SXSW from its early beginnings to the blockbuster event it is today – we can’t wait.“

    Street banners throughout the city welcome PCMA and its attendees, and a special lounge at Austin Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA) will treat arriving attendees to live music and genuine Austin flair while they register for the conference. A spectacular Opening Reception is being hosted at the Palmer Events Center, the Austin Convention Center’s sister property.

    “I am extremely pleased that PCMA’s Convening Leaders Annual Meeting is in Austin,” said Mark Tester, Director of The Austin Convention Center. “As PCMA is known throughout the meetings industry as a leader in innovation, we are excited to showcase the Austin Convention Center as a hallmark of innovation while showing the world that Austin is a top-tier meetings destination.”

    Nearly ten million people have attended 6,000+ events, including over 900 conventions, at the LEED® Gold-certified Austin Convention Center since it opened in 1992.

    ![ACCD Downtown View](//images.contentful.com/a0fcgy83nees/nvfLkfk3UksU8E66ciESi/2e971a87e6fbe5d654f06ce6e3476517/ACC_DT_View.jpg)

    The Austin Convention Center Department (ACCD) is pleased to announce that they have achieved ‘carbon neutral’ status for the year 2013, the first department in the City of Austin to do so.

    The goal of carbon neutral city operations by 2020 was established through resolution from the Austin City Council in 2007. The ACCD attained this status 7 years ahead of schedule. The ACCD plans to continue to measure, reduce, and offset emissions for 2014 and 2015, as well as each year into the future. Through Google search, we believe that the Austin Convention Center has become the first convention center in North America to attain ‘carbon neutral’ status for 2013 with plans to continue offsetting its emissions each year into the future. ACCD’s departmental climate protection plan between 2007 and 2013 reduced department emissions by:

    - Retro-commissioning the Austin Convention Center (ACC) to improve energy efficiency.
    - Purchasing 100 percent wind energy for electricity needs.
    - Purchasing Energy Star certified products for new and replacement equipment.
    - Upgrading lights and fixtures throughout the various department facilities from HID, incandescent, metal halide and other older less efficient bulbs and fixtures to newer more efficient fluorescent, compact fluorescent and LED bulbs and fixtures.
    - Limiting operation of high energy use equipment like escalators and HVAC in ACC and PEC to be used only as needed during events.
    - Use of electric, hybrid and alternative fuels for department vehicles and equipment.

    These and other sustainable actions reduced the ACCD’s 2013 departmental operations for scope 1 and 2 emissions to 3,450 metric tons, which was third party verified by Ruby Canyon Engineering. ACCD then purchased and retired 3,450 carbon offset credits from the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate Action Reserve (CAR). The projects the ACCD support are the Capricorn Ridge IV wind project and Rio Grande Valley Land Fill Gas Project.

    ACCD Director Mark Tester said, “We are so proud to set the bar for carbon neutrality for convention centers. Austin is a leader in the global fight against climate change and visitors to Austin can be a part of that effort when they attend a convention event in our city.”

    The Austin Convention Center Department manages the LEED® Gold certified Austin Convention Center and the Palmer Events Center, along with three parking facilities. Nearly 11 million people have attended 4,000+ combined events at the Convention Center, which opened in 1992, and the PEC which opened in 2002. Events at both facilities can be accessed at [www.austinconventioncenter.com](https://www.austinconventioncenter.com/) or [www.palmereventscenter.com](http://www.palmereventscenter.com/).

To be honored by a magazine of its stature among meeting professionals is quite an accomplishment and I am extremely proud of our entire team for their role in winning this award.”

    Roman Polvinale joins the Austin Convention Center’s (ACCD) star-studded catering team as general manager to continue the department’s tradition of five-star cuisine coupled with world-class presentation and service.

    In the wake of the devastation left by Hurricane Harvey in late August, Keller Williams Realty – an Austin-based real estate company with over 139,000 agents worldwide – changed their annual Mega CAMP event into a concentrated relief effort called Mega RELIEF, running from September 11 through September 15. Like previous Mega CAMP conferences, Mega RELIEF was based at the Austin Convention Center.

    “We are thrilled to partner with Keller Williams in this effort,” said Paul Barnes, Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Austin Convention Center. “Over the past ten years, we have enjoyed a strong working relationship with Keller Williams Realty while hosting their Mega Camp conferences. Immediately following (the hurricane), there were a lot of questions and unfortunately, not many answers. Keller Williams took an aggressively proactive approach and quickly retooled Mega Camp into Mega Relief, directly tending to the needs of thousands of individuals who needed immediate help.”

    Austin Mayor Steve Adler asked Austin to help those whose homes were flooded by Hurricane Harvey by delivering new cleaning supplies to the Austin Convention Center. Thousands of Keller Williams agents were staging from the convention center, delivering cleaning supplies to affected communities, and helping people clean up their damaged homes.

    Anywhere from 60 to 80 buses filled with volunteers and trucks full of supplies headed to some of the areas most ravaged by Harvey, like Katy, Sealy, Rockport, and Houston. Along with cleaning supplies, volunteers brought staples such as water, food, and clothing to those in need. Over 4,000 volunteers logged in excess of 60,000 hours of work. In addition, hundreds of meals were contributed to Austin Resource Center for the Homeless. For more information, please go to [www.megarelief.org](https://www.megarelief.org/) or find #megarelief on Twitter.

    Over ten million people have attended 3,500+ events, including over 900 conventions, at the LEED® Gold-certified Austin Convention Center since it opened in 1992.

    \n\nIt is with honor that the publishers and editors of ConventionSouth, the\nnational
    multimedia resource for planning events in the South, present Austin Convention
    Center with a 2017 Readers’\nChoice Award.\n\n“ConventionSouth readers and fans
    have voted to decide the best meeting sites in the South, and it is no surprise
    to us that Austin Convention Center has been selected to receive our annual Readers’
    Choice Award,” said\nConventionSouth Publisher J. Talty O’Connor. “The value in
    receiving this prestigious recognition is that it comes from the United States’
    top meeting professionals who hold events in the South. These planners demand
    the highest level of customer service and quality facilities, and they have contributed
    in determining that Austin Convention Center indeed displays the commitment to
    professionalism, creativity and service that they require.”\n\nAustin Convention
    Center is among 300 convention and visitor bureaus (CVBs), meeting facilities
    and hotels located across the South to receive this year’s Readers’ Choice Award.
    Throughout the year, meeting professionals nominated the meeting sites they believe
    provide exemplary service for group events. The nominated sites are then compiled
    onto an online ballot where meeting professionals and fans are asked to vote for
    the best of the best. With over 6,000 voters participating in the selection process
    and the highest social media interaction to date, this has been the most successful
    and engaging year yet!\n\nSince creation in 2001, this is the eighth time that
    Austin Convention Center has received the award, making it an even greater honor
    to present it with a 2017 Readers’ Choice Award. Austin Convention Center will
    be featured as an award\nrecipient in the December 2017 Awards Issue of ConventionSouth
    magazine. This exciting issue will also showcase some of the most talented meeting
    professionals in the nation as ConventionSouth also presents planners with its
    annual “Meeting Professionals To Watch” designation. “Featuring peer advice and
    trade secrets from our Meeting Professionals to Watch in 2017, our Awards Issue
    is one of the most popular must-read resources within the meetings industry,”
    O’Connor said.\n\nCelebrating over 30 years as a leading meeting planning resource,
    ConventionSouth magazine is based in Gulf Shores, Ala., and is distributed to
    more than 18,000 meeting professionals located across the country who book meetings
    held within the South, according to O’Connor."
